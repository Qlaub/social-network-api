## Installation
First clone the code onto your computer, then in your terminal navigate to the root directory of the cloned project, and finally run 'npm i' in your terminal to install the required dependencies.

## Usage
While still in your terminal at the root directory of the cloned project, run 'npm start' to start the local server. Use Insomnia or a similar application to test the various server routes. By default, the server is hosted on 'localhost:3001'. A simple route to try is a get request on 'localhost:3001/api/users/', which should return all users (blank by default). Navigate to the routes/api directory and look at 'thought-routes.js' and 'user-routes.js' to see more info on valid routes.
